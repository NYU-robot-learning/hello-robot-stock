### Assembly Instructions
1. Print necessary files. Each respective file folder contains suggested print, support, and orientation settings. 
2. Assemble phone holder using instructions in the [Phone Holder](#phone-holder) section. 
3. Take the robot clamp components 1 and 2 ([robotClamp.stl](RobotClamp/robotClamp.stl) and [robotClamp_insert.stl](RobotClamp/robotClamp_insert.stl)), add super glue to the underpart of component 1 in which component 2 can be inserted into. 
4. Press component 2 into component 1 where the glue has been applied, such that component 2 is centered and equal amounts stick out from the clamp. Hold down for at least 15 sec. (Note that the glue takes around a day to fully set)
